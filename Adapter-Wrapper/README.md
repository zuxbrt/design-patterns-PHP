`Adapter / Wrapper pattern`
=====================

Brief explanation
-------

``
"_In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface._" - "From book - Head First Design Patterns - Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates, Elisabeth Robson, Eric Freeman."
``

It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
